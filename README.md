# # 🍽️ Restaurant Rating Prediction

This project focuses on building a regression model to predict restaurant ratings based on various features such as cuisine type, price, and location.

## 📌 Objective
To predict the rating of a restaurant using machine learning techniques and gain insights into the key factors influencing customer satisfaction.

## 📁 Dataset
- Contains details such as:
  - Restaurant Name
  - Cuisine
  - Location
  - Price Range
  - Customer Reviews
  - Rating (Target)

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding
- Feature scaling where necessary

## 🤖 Model Used
